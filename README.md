# Welcome to SimpleDeckBuilder

Hiya! This is my super simple deck building web application.

Don't need a moxfield or archidekt to build your next Magic: the Gathering deck? Well look no further! You're in for a big 'ole treat.

## What does it do?

It builds MTG decks!

## Anything else?

Nope!

(Also let's you export them in a txt file... but I couldn't help myself y'know?)

## Any plans to add other functionality?

Absolutely not!

(Actually I'm planning to do a little more. Checkout the TODO.md for more info teehee~)

## What did you use for this extraordinary piece of software?

Oh you know a little bit of [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) for structure. A splash of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) for responsiveness and styling. Throw in some [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for components and retrieving [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com) data and you got yourself one stupid simple deck builder!

## Why does this exist?

Well simply because I wanted to make it. There are hundreds of other deckbuilding apps with crazy features and this one just gives you the ability to build, export, and view.

Please don't take this too seriously. Feel free to use it to build any deck you'd like.

Or use another deck builder.
I promise that I won't be _too_ offended.

#### `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

Do whatever you want with the code. But if you start making some money you have to give me a cut.

If you don't I'll find you.

Just kidding.
