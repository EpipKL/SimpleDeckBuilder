Hi welcome to the list that will probably never get done. Grab a coffee or tea and stay a while!

## Immediate updates

Wow I cannot believe it's taking a bajillion years to get this to mvp.

- Get `.txt` exports working.
- Fix symbology.
- Pagination.

## Future updates

This is where things that will probably never get put in go.

- Fix some modal bugs.
- Better caching system.
- Make an export deck function to give `.html` or `.json` files to allow users to play around with their completed decklists. (Maybe also some type of embed too?)
- Clean up some code.
- Improve some UI. Probably will do this instead of anything else productive on the list :)

If I finish this entire list I swear I will eat my shoe.
