# Branch - refactor/main/2

## What I've done

- LOTS of code refactoring. Getting rid of useless files
  - Removed css files and directories (Bootstrap handles everything)
  - Moved main javscript file to root. (Cause it just feels better y'know?)
- Allows up to two commanders for deck builder.
- Fixed issues with the search results loader rendering.
- Added new stylings to Deck List.

## Things to do

Lots and lots my dudes. Next version should handle some bigger updates AND provide a new TODO markdown file.

Just decided to put this versions inside here for safe keeping right now :)
