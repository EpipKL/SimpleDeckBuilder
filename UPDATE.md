# Branch - refactor/main/2.5

## What I've done

- LOTS of code refactoring. Getting rid of useless files and adding a billion js files
  - Removed css files and directories (Bootstrap handles everything)
  - Moved main javscript file to root. (Cause it just feels better y'know?)

The rest of this is because I procrastinated and did other stuff on this branch. oopsies.

- Allows up to two commanders for deck builder.
- Fixed issues with the search results loader rendering.
- Added new stylings to Deck List.
- Fixed modal issue with cached modal storage.

All in all it's turned into a bit more of spaghetti code but this will make it WAY easier to update and clean up in the future.
